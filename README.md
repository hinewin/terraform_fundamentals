# Terraform Fundamentals

This repository aims to build a solid foundation for using Terraform, a widely-used infrastructure as code tool. Its objective is to guide users through important Terraform concepts, empowering them to manage and automate their infrastructure effectively.

This guide will be using [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html) as the main cloud provider.

## Chapter 1 - Providers & Resources

Providers are plugins that connect Terraform to various cloud services (like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), while Resources represent infrastructure objects (like virtual machines or databases) that the Providers can manage. This chapter serves as a stepping stone into effective infrastructure management with Terraform.
